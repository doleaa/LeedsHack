# NuSeek

A new way to interact with the soulseek protocol that provides users the ability host their own music server connected to the soulseek network.

# Note:
This is still in very early development and requires knowledge of nodejs / react / python to be used effectively


# Dependencies
To run the python server you will need to have pre-installed museekd the daemon process that communicates with the soulseek network.
